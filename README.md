# NYC-scaled-garbage-points-map

An artist put out a request for help creating point data that would show where all the garbage facilities in NYC would be if they were scaled down to fit onto Fresh Kills Park in Staten Island. The data would be used in an art project about Fresh Kills.

This was fairly simple to do in QGIS, so I volunteered to create the small data set for him.
